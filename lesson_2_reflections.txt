Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do
it?
A: Initialising of a reposetory is a start point after what each change
inside it will be tracked.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Stagging area is like some reloading point where you can choose the
order you want to make your changes to become live. The files on these
stage are already changed but still not "live". In case you made few
changes, it's better to push these changes one-by-one to check they do
not crash any.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit 
per logical change?
A: You can check what is added to the staging area and how it differ
from the "live" files to make sure you'll commit only one logical 
change.
