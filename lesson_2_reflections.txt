Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do
it?
A: Initialising of a reposetory is a start point after what each change
inside it will be tracked.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Stagging area is like some reloading point where you can choose the
order you want to make your changes to become live. The files on these
stage are already changed but still not "live". In case you made few
changes, it's better to push these changes one-by-one to check they do
not crash any.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit 
per logical change?
A: You can check what is added to the staging area and how it differ
from the "live" files to make sure you'll commit only one logical 
change.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping
your history organized? How would branches help?
A: They would be helpful in case you decide to check some code
optimisation or to add some new feature that doesn't influence
on the main part of programm. Branches could help to separate
the complex developing process into the smaller and more understandable
parts.
